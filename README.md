# Line-Following-Bot
Line following bot code for AirTech

What works:
- Bot follows the line pretty smoothly.
- Left turn algorithm.

What Doesn't Work:
- Gets confused at sharp turns, has unpridictable behaviour. 

To Do:
- Lots of testing to fine-tune the motor speed constants.
- Add an automatic calibration function, use a button and an LED.
- Use encoder to help identify different intersections.
- Use faster motors.
